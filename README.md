Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning is classified into three types. Based on type of the data dealing with its divided into following types
 
Supervised Machine learning algorithmns:
•	Decision Trees
•	Naive Bayes Classification
•	Support vector machines for classification problems
•	Random forest for classification and regression problems
•	Linear regression for regression problems
•	Ordinary Least Squares Regression
•	Logistic Regression
•	Ensemble Methods
Un-Supervised Machine learning algos:
•	K-means for clustering problems
•	Apriori algorithm for association rule learning problems
•	Principal Component Analysis
•	Singular Value Decomposition
•	Independent Component Analysis
